  Usage: bech32 [PREFIX]
    Convert to and from bech32 strings. Data are read from standard input.

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    PREFIX                   An optional human-readable prefix (e.g. 'addr').
                               - When provided, the input text is decoded from various encoding formats and re-encoded to bech32 using the given prefix.
                               - When omitted, the input text is decoded from bech32 to base16.

  Supported encoding formats: Base16, Bech32 & Base58.

  Examples:
    To Bech32:
      $ bech32 base16_ <<< 706174617465
      base16_1wpshgct5v5r5mxh0

      $ bech32 base58_ <<< Ae2tdPwUPEYy
