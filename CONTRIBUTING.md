## Types of contribution

Provide information on what kinds of contributions your project is looking for here. For example, these can be bug reports, help answering user questions, improving documentation, bug fixes, and new feature implementations.

## Openness

The configuration of an open project enables frictionless contributing. Projects should be discoverable and well-documented. Anyone within our Intersect MBO should be able to find a desired project and ramp up without direct guidance from host team members.

## Code of Conduct

[The Code of Conduct](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/OSC-documentation/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) governs this project and everyone participating. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [oso@intersectmbo.org](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/committee-documentation-template/blob/main/oso@intersectmbo.org).

## Reporting Bugs

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible.

## Feature requests

Add information on how to submit feature requests here. Also, include information on what contributors can expect regarding time first to respond and process after that.

## Contributing documentation

Include information on any documentation best practices your project follows, how to build documentation, checks to run, and how to submit the changes made back to the project.

## Transparency

For guest teams to be able to contribute meaningfully to a project, the host team must be transparent. This means that guest teams should be able to have an understanding of:

- The project/repo and its direction
- Outstanding feature requirements
- Progress on feature requirements
- Decision-making of the host team

## Prioritized Mentorship

Mentorship from the host team to the guest team via maintainers is crucial to Intersect MBO. Contributors on guest teams are up-leveled so that they understand enough about the host teamâ€™s project/repo to change it successfully.
